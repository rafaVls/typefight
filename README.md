# Typefight
Typefight is a typing game where you get a random sentence, type it in, and see your score, as well as other people's score.

This app comes from my desire to learn about databases and how to interact with them. In this case, I'm using python's Flask framework for the backend.

## Features
The game randomly assigns the player a short sentence, which they must type (including characters like spaces, periods, commas, etc.). After which, the player gets the time it took them to type in that sentence, and how long it takes other players who've typed the same sentence.
